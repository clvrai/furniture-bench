Installation Guide (FurnitureSim)
=========================================================

FurnitureSim is a high-speed and realistic simulation of FurnitureBench, built using IsaacGym and Factory.
It is designed to be a seamless substitution of the real-world environment, and enables rapid prototyping of new algorithms.

Now we will take a look how to install FurnitureSim.
You can install FurnitureSim using Docker or from source.

.. prerequisites::
    Prerequisites

    -  üõ†Ô∏è Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    - NVIDIA RTX GPU
    -  üìñ Download `Isaac Gym <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym>`__
    -  üìñ `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__


Installation using Docker (Option 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide a docker image that includes everything needed for FurnitureSim. To use FurnitureSim, you only need to run our docker image.

1. Download IsaacGym from `NVIDIA Developer <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym>`__. Start by creating an NVIDIA account, agree to the terms and conditions, and then download `Isaac Gym - Ubuntu Linux 18.04 / 20.04 Preview 4 release`. Unzip the downloaded file and move the folder to the desired location.

2. üìñ Download `nvidia-docker2 <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html>`__

3. In case you initiate, execute the GPU-supported client Docker by following :ref:`Run Client`.


Local Installation (Option 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need FurnitureSim in your own environment, you can install FurnitureSim by manually installing dependencies as follows:


1. (Optional) Create and activate a conda environment:

  .. code::

        conda create -n furniture-bench python=3.8
        conda activate furniture-bench

2. Download IsaacGym from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym and install it:

  .. code::

        cd </path/to/isaacgym>
        cd python
        pip install -e isaacgym

3. Clone and install IsaacGymEnvs:

  .. code::

        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs
        pip install -e IsaacGymEnvs

4. Clone and install FurnitureBench:

  .. code::

        git clone https://github.com/clvrai/furniture-bench.git
        pip install -e furniture-bench

5. Install other dependencies:

  .. code::

        conda install mamba -c conda-forge
        mamba install -c pytorch -c fair-robotics -c aihabitat -c conda-forge polymetis
        pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Install PyTorch again if you want another PyTorch version (Polymetis overrides PyTorch). As an example, we install PyTorch 1.10 with CUDA 11.3:

  .. code::

        conda install pytorch==1.10 torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

Running FurnitureSim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run Docker image
-----------------

Run the docker image if you did not install the code with local installation.

1. Set the environment variables

  .. code:: bash

    # With display
    xhost +

    export CLIENT_DOCKER=client-gpu                        # (Case1: local build)
    export CLIENT_DOCKER=furniturebench/client-gpu:latest  # (Case2: docker pull)

    # Set absolute path to the furniture-benchmark repo
    export FURNITURE_BENCH=</path/to/furniture-benchmark>

    # Isaac Gym absolute path
    export ISAAC_GYM_PATH=</path/to/isaacgym>         # path to isaacgym downloaded from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym

    # Launch the image
    cd $FURNITURE_BENCH
    ./launch_client.sh --sim-gpu

Test Run for Simulator
----------------------

.. code:: bash

    cd /furniture-bench

    # args: --furniture [lamp | square_table | desk | drawer | cabinet | round_table | stool | chair | one_leg]

    python furniture_bench/scripts/run_sim_env.py --furniture square_table --no-action
    # Headless
    python furniture_bench/scripts/run_sim_env.py --furniture square_table --no-action --headless

.. tip::

    In FurnitureSim, the 3D furniture models from FurnitureBench are transformed into the Signed Distance Function (SDF) format for use in the simulation.
    The first time the simulator is run, it will take some time (~ few minutes) to generate the SDF meshes, but subsequent runs will be faster as the simulator can load the pre-cached SDF meshes.

FurnitureSim Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~
Simulation parameters including mass, inertia, dt, etc. can be found in ``furniture_bench/sim_config.py``.

Supported Furniture Models
~~~~~~~~~

The simulator currently supports automatic assembly scripts for the following furniture models.
The script for all furniture models will be available soon.
