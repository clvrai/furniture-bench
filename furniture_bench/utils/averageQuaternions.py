# Code from: https://github.com/christophhagen/averaging-quaternions/blob/master/averageQuaternions.py
# This file implements correct quaternion averaging.
#
# This method is computationally expensive compared to naive mean averaging.
# If only low accuracy is required (or the quaternions have similar orientations),
# then quaternion averaging can possibly be done through simply averaging the
# components.

# Side note: In computer graphics, averaging or blending of two quaternions is often done through
# spherical linear interploation (slerp). Even though it's often used it might not be the best
# way to do things, as described in this post:
