FurnitureBench is the real-world furniture assembly benchmark, which aims at providing a reproducible and easy-to-use platform for long-horizon complex robotic manipulation.

It features
- Long-horizon complex manipulation tasks
- Standardized environment setup
- Python-based robot control stack
- FurnitureSim: a simulated environment
- Large-scale teleoperation dataset (200+ hours)
